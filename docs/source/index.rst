===================
 üçí  Griottes üçí 
===================

This is a tool to maximize the amount of information you can extract from your microscopy images.

**Griottes** is an easy-to-use, one-stop, Python library to extract single-cell information from your images and return the data in a networkx graph recapitulating the tissue structure.

 - It works on segmented **2D** and **3D** images, no extra fuss required! We like to use `CellPose <https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for our image segmentation - but that's just a question of taste. You can also use dataframes as inputs.

 - On both **2D** and **3D** images you can easily insert extra information from supplementary fluorescence channels and embed the information on the graph.

**Griottes** allows you to easily generate networks from your image data as shown in the image below.
